                    I spent my last internship doing software engineering on data pipelines and analysis tools used by hardware teams at Apple.  I developed web features using Ruby on Rails, Ember.js, and data pipeline work using Apache Spark.  I even got to try some machine learning by applying an SVM classifier with scikit-learn.

                    I certainly learned a lot from working at such a large tech company, and a company whose revenue comes from selling hardware rather than software services.  My managers also provided me the opportunity to take on more responsibiltity than I ever have. I am very grateful for this internship!

                    I worked as a Data Engineer Intern on Shopify's Data Acquisition team in Toronto, ON during the summer of 2016.  I really liked working in data and hope to continue to work in data in future co-ops.  I gained experience working with <%= link_to 'Apache Kafka', 'http://kafka.apache.org/', style: "color: #FFFCEF" %>, <%= link_to 'Chef', 'http://www.chef.io', style: "color: #FFFCEF" %>, <%= link_to 'Apache Spark', 'http://spark.apache.org/', style: "color: #FFFCEF" %> and <%= link_to 'D3.js', 'https://d3js.org/', style: "color: #FFFCEF" %>.  I got to improve, maintain, and build parts of Shopify's data pipelines and support members of the data team as well as outside stakeholders like product managers and growth folk.

                    Being on the data acquisition team, I learned just how much work goes into creating a reliable, high quality data set that can be used for analysis.  As well, after working on a data focused team, I developed an intuition for answering questions with data as well as what types of data would not be helpful.  This was truly an amazing experience! Thanks again, Shopify.

                <p>I was lucky enough to work at Shopify during my second co-op term as a full stack software developer from September 2015 to December 2015.  During my time there, I worked on Shopify's <em>Transfers</em> feature with the Inventory team.  We released the feature in November 2015 and I supported it until the end of my Internship in December.  I really enjoyed the agile, test driven development environment and hope to continue to find workspaces that move quickly while building a high quality product.  </p>

                <p>I really enjoyed my first co-op term at Grantek Systems Integration from January 2015 to April 2015.  I worked on Human Machine Interface applications for integrated manufacturing systems running on programmable logic controllers and supervisory control and data acquisition systems, in several projects for large industrial clients.  The software I used for this was <%= link_to 'Schneider Electric Vijeo Designer', 'http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/product-range/1054-vijeo-designer/', style: "color: #FFFCEF;" %> and <%= link_to 'Siemens WinCC', 'http://w3.siemens.com/mcms/human-machine-interface/en/visualization-software/scada/simatic-wincc/pages/default.aspx', style: "color: #FFFCEF;" %>. </p>

                <p>I also developed some of my first web development experience at Grantek, and got to be part of a project deployed to Azure using ASP.NET and SQL Server.  It was here that I first learned model-view-controller paradigms as well as SQL syntax.  I really enjoyed this project and it inspired me to continue with web development in my career.  Thank you, Grantek!</p>
